**Synchrony** is a new way to synchronize clouds in GNOME.
It is based on [rclone](https://rclone.org/) to provide the ability
to synchronize as much cloud providers as possible.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installing

Since this app is still under development, there are no stable builds. But you
still have an option to run the app from source.

There are two options how to do it:

1. Run the app from [GNOME Builder](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.Builder)
2. Use the following commands to build it with Meson:

```sh
meson _build
sudo meson install -C _build
```
